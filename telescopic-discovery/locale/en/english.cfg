[item-description]
volatile-memory-unit=An electronic component that uses magnetic fields to store data, similiar to rope core memory. Must remain powered to retain data.
writable-memory=Several volatile memory units wired together to create a blank canvas for data storage.
astronomical-data=Data from a radiotelescope. Process it quickly!
voyager-memory-unit=How did the voyager probe turn volatile rope core memory into static memory? By strapping a nuclear reactor onto it! Because if you lose power, everything goes to hell anyway.
radiotelescope=We are made of starstuff. The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, were all formed in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are a way for the cosmos to know itself. -Carl Sagan
telescopic-data-processor=Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. - Carl Sagan
